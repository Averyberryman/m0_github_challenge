# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
- First, you must fork an existing repository in git hub
- then, run the command git clone <ssh key> to establish a local clone on your machine
- now these files can be edited locally and pushed back up to github
